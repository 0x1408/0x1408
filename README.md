My name is 0x1408, I am an 14 years old software developer and reverse engineer from Germany. I am mainly interested in reverse engineering, cyber security, software development and server administration. After successfully completing school, I planned to turn my interests into a job. My current projects are a forum about reverse engineering and software development named "pwn3d" and an external modification for the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive named "Interstellar".
