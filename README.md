<p align="center">
My name is 0x1408, I am a 14 years old software developer and reverse engineer from Germany. I am mainly interested in reverse engineering, cybersecurity, software development and server administration. After I successfully finished school, I wanted to turn my interests into a profession. My current projects are a one-to-one copy of the cheatloader from gamesense and an external cheat for the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive called "Interstellar".
