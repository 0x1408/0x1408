My name is 0x1408, I am a 14 years old software developer and reverse engineer from Germany. I am mainly interested in reverse engineering, cybersecurity, software development and server administration. After I successfully finished school, I wanted to turn my interests into a profession. My current projects are a launcher for cheats that were developed for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive named "pwned" and an external modification for the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive called "Interstellar".
